# AI-Image-Checker
AI has some characteristic traits in image generation capacity. it introduces random noise that is, often, detectable with image manipulation, software and forensic analysis. This noise is not truly random in the physical sense; rather, it reflects statistical artifacts of the generative process itself. Most image-generation models synthesise images by sampling from learned probability distributions, which can leave behind subtle but consistent signatures like

1. abnormal pixel correlations
2. repeating frequency patterns
3. inconsistencies in high-frequency detail—that differ from those produced by real camera sensors

This model aims to accurately tell an AI generated image from an organic image with a level of certainty.
